			<h3><b>Emphasis-DB</b></h3>
			
			<p>
				During my time at General Assembly Denver, I had the exciting opportunity
				to work in a team of three building an automatically populating online database
				for the <a href="https://emphasis.ai"><u>Emphasis AI</u></a> project, an
				experimental text editor that utilizes algorithms based on the latest neuroscience
				theory to highlight your text based on how engaging it is to the human brain.
				
				<br>
				
				<a href="http://emphasisdb.herokuapp.com"><img src="./emphasis-db.png"></a>
				
				<br>

				I was able to develop the server that interfaces with the Emphasis AI API,
				performing analysis on each new data entry as it comes in, either from users
				who wish to analyze excerpts of text they have found or written, or
				scraped from the Internet by the bots contained in the server code. You can take
				a look at the project <a href="http://emphasisdb.herokuapp.com"><u>here</u></a>,
				and add things to the database for analysis yourself!

			<h3><b>Clean Chat App</b></h3>
			<p>
				<a href="http://clean-chat-app.herokuapp.com"><i><u>(link)</u></i></a>
				<a href="http://github.com/keenmaster486/clean-chat-app"><i><u>(source code)</u></i></a>
				<br><br>
				A cross-platform group chat app, compatible with any modern web browser,
				mobile devices, and many legacy computers via the legacy client developed
				in Visual Basic 6. A very interesting exercise in modern server programming.
				The app uses Node.js with Express for the backend server, and React for the
				web frontend. The mobile app was completely rewritten in React Native.
				<br><br>
				Also see <a href="http://github.com/keenmaster486/ccaJavaBackend"><i><u>here</u></i></a>
				for a backend for this app, completely compatible with the Node.js version,
				rewritten using Java.
